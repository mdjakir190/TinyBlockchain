# ⛓️ TinyBlockchain (Python)

A minimal implementation of a Blockchain data structure in Python. This project demonstrates how blocks are linked together using SHA-256 hashing.

## 🚀 Key Concepts Covered
* **Genesis Block:** The very first block in the chain.
* **Hashing:** Using SHA-256 to secure data.
* **Immutability:** How each block is linked to the previous one.
* **Mining Simulation:** Basic structure for adding new blocks.

## 🛠️ How to Run
No external libraries required! Just pure Python.
```bash
python blockchain.py
